        <p class="pad"><strong>Ducted </strong></p>
        <p>The ducted systems we install and maintain are a virtual who’s who of high quality residential HVAC manufacturers. These include Amana (for whom we are the exclusive dealer in the area), Bryant, Carrier, Goodman, Lennox, Rheem-Rudd, TempStar and York. We also offer unparalled expertise and options for ducted HVAC systems including conventional rectangular or spiral ducting. Your particular situation may lead us to recommend the increasingly popular mini duct systems from Unico. These are in especially high demand in situations where traditional air conditioning ducting systems are not practical.</p>

        <p><strong>Ductless </strong></p>
        <p>Ducted air conditioning systems are not practical in some cases due to the nature of the construction of the home or because the small size of the application simply does not warrant a ducted system. In addition there are specific areas such as conference and computer rooms that often need year round air conditioning and their own discreet temperature control systems.</p>
        <p>In these cases we often recommend proven, high quality ductless air conditioning systems from companies like Fujitsu, LG, Sanyo or Mitsubishi. </p>

        <p><strong>Hydronic </strong></p>
        <p>Hydronic heating systems all involve the use of warm water to provide heat. These systems are either conventional, hydro air or radiant systems. These systems typically are more expensive to install but provide more cost efficient, environmentally friendly operation in the long run. And because most hydronic systems are installed in the sub floor, there are no visible vents in the flooring or walls, improving the homes aesthetic appeal. </p>
        <p>The hydronic heat systems of choice are made by Viessmann, Bouderus and Utica.</p>

        <p><strong> Alternative Energy Heating &amp; Cooling </strong></p>
        <p>UG Nason’s has extensive experience and training in the many energy efficitent heating and cooling alternatives available today. These include geothermal, hybrid, ultra high efficient systems such as Acadia and solar panels for hot water. Ask us about what energy efficient options might be applicable for your particular project. </p>
